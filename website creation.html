                                    <h1>How I made this website</h1>
									
								
								</header>
                                <p>I started this journey with watching my teachers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIlGQkW_Pt3zHIw07BWl5zg">videos</a> on the subject that can be found on YouTube as well as downloading software to get this project done. This was my first attempt at using HTML so I thought it wise to start out with a template for my site. Similar templates as well as this one can be found on <a href="https://html5up.net/">HTML5up</a>.</p>
                                
                                <p>The program I used to manipulate the template is called <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a>, a surprisingly simple and easy to use editor. After tinkering for a while in the Brackets editor I got some sense to what í was doing and started thinking about the way I wanted my webpage to look like. I sketched up a little drawing with my idea, the goal was to keep it as easy to navigate as í could while still having it be somewhat elegant.</p>
								
                                <p class="aligncenter"><img src="images/teikning.jpg" width="350" height="450"></p>

                                <p>So now the real work would begin, editing the template to match my vision.</p>
                                <div class="image main"><img src="images/frontpage.bmp" alt="" />
                                <p>On this picture you can see how the template looked before my changes, if you want to see the original code in its entirety it may be found here, <a href="https://github.com/hakonjarlk/Vefsidan/blob/main/Original%20front%20page.html">front page</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hakonjarlk/Vefsidan/blob/main/Original%20about%20me.html">about me</a>. For comparison to the final product, you could right click on this page and click Inspect or see it here by clicking <a href="https://github.com/hakonjarlk/Vefsidan/blob/main/index.html">front page</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hakonjarlk/Vefsidan/blob/main/generic.html">about me</a>. After comparing the stock template and the code for this website you are well on your way with knowing how to make your own.</p>
                                
                                <p>When I felt happy with my result, I had to get it online for you to see. That is where GitHub and Git comes into play, <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> is a webpage to manage all kinds of projects. There you have version control over the code you are working on for an example. <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is then used to manage the files you have in your project’s repository. The process of uploading this website started with me creating a repository on GitHub. Instructions on how that is done may be found <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo">here.</a></p>
                                <div class="image main"><img src="images/repository.bmp" alt="" />
                                <p> Then I uploaded my files using Git GUI, the reason I went with that option rather than Git bash was ease of use. I had tried and failed a few times with Git bash and for some reason the bash dialog box was not working as it should have. Uploading with Git GUI was very easy and straight forward, right clicking in the folder where you keep the files you want in your repository and clicking Git GUI opens this window.</p>
                                <div class="image main"><img src="images/gitgui.jpg" alt="" />
                                
                                <p>There you see some files I the upper left box that have not been uploaded to the repository, by first clicking Stage changed (marked Nr.1), then writing a commit message in the text box (marked Nr.2), click Commit (marked Nr. 3) and finally clicking Push (marked Nr. 4).</p>
                                <p>Now that everything was finished and ready I made a link for the webpage, that was done under the settings tab on the repository and finding the GitHub Pages settings seen on the picture below. There you select your branch as main and save. Then you get the shareable link for your page.    </p>
                                <div class="image main"><img src="images/source.bmp" alt="" />
